                            <p>This is a pen and paper quiz round. Participants have to answer questions on Electronics and General Knowledge. 20 questions are presented to each team, and 40 minutes are given for them to complete the quiz. Different amounts of points are awarded for each correct answer, based on the difficulty of the question. Questions will be of 3 difficulties, and 100, 75 and 50 points will be awarded for the answers respectively, based on their decreasing difficulty. The tally of points of each team is calculated and noted by the judges. The top 10 teams qualify for the final round. The points accumulated by each team will be considered as the virtual cash available to them for the final round
                            </p>
                            <h2>ROUND-2</h2>
                            <p>
                                A list of electrical components with their prices, and a list of electronic circuits (from basic to complex ones) will be provided to each team. Teams must purchase the components (by spending the virtual cash from round one) and build any circuit of their choice from the list. On completion of a circuit, a team can sell the circuit to make a profit, and can either choose to spend the virtual cash on building another circuit, or to lock the virtual cash they have made. A team can make as many circuits as they want, as long as they have the virtual cash to buy the components required, and all circuits are completed before the deadline. Components that are unused can be refunded at 50% of their initial cost at any time. The team with the most virtual money in hand after 2 hours wins!

                            <p>It's a fun event wherein you enter the arena with your partner tied together, with pirate eye patches on dodging bamboos, balancing on tires and overcoming other obstacles and unchain themselves by finding the key hidden at the end of their path , then play a game or two( darts, finding coloured balls) and split from their partner from there on, one of them enters a laser arena and try to dodge them while finding hidden objects on the path, while the other partner going to the ropes and sensors arena and cross it quickly without setting the buzzers on. When two of them meet, after they had completed all their tasks, time stops.

                               A programming question would be provided with a time limit of 30 mins. For the first 15 minutes, one of the team members would code alone for the given problem, after which the other member would have to continue to complete the code from where his/her partner left off. The twist however, is that no interaction or discussion of any sort would be allowed to the teams once the question is assigned

                            <p>REGISTERED students will go through a pen-paper test where different types of questions will be asked . The question can be technical, like identifying the components, or simple circuit solving. Also, the questions can be such that it tests your mental ability like puzzle solving etc. Time of completing the round is 20 minutes

                               Selected students will then be divided on the basis of their strengths i.e. either you code or design a circuit. For those who are good in coding, there can be two types of questions- solving the given problem, and debugging the code. For those who do circuit designing, they have to design a working circuit and show it to the judges. Students will be awarded points for the same. To make this round more interesting, some fun tasks will also be added. Completion of these tasks will also result in fetching them some more points.

                               Selected students in the final round will be asked to design the circuit in MULTISIM software for simulation as well as circuit designing. Students will be judged on how fast they complete this round and the total number of points.
